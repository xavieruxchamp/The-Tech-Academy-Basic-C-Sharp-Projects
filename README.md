## Car Insurance
For this project, I used the .NET Framework. which enabled me create a new website, including Controllers and Views. I also worked with data Models.

## Students
With this console application, I am follwing the Code First and DB Initialization concepts whereby I am updating or creating a database where one is not already available. This project required me to setup Entity Framework.

## Azure project
For this project, I leverage the .NET Core Framework, which allows me to create an application that works on most platforms. I also posted the project to Azure.
