Here are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework

## Projects

- [Car Insurance](https://github.com/xavieruxchamp/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance)
- [Students](https://github.com/xavieruxchamp/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/FinalAssignmenModule12)
- [Azure](https://github.com/xavieruxchamp/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/MyFirstAzureWebApp)


## Car Insurance
For this project, I used the .NET Framework. which enabled me to create a new website, including Controllers and Views. I also worked with data Models.

## Students
With this console application, I followed the Code First and DB Initialization concepts whereby I updated or created a database where one was not already available. This project required me to setup Entity Framework.

## Azure project
For this project, I leveraged the .NET Core Framework, which allowed me to create an application that works on most platforms. I also posted the project to Azure.
