## Car Insurance
For this project, I used the .NET Core framework. which enabled me create a new website, including Controllers, Views. I also worked with data Models.

## Students
With this console application, I am follwing the Code First and DB Initialization concepts whereby I am updating or creating a database where one is not already available. This project required me to setup Entity Framework.
